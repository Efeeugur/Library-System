## 4. System Architecture

### 4.1 Interface Definitions

#### IUserManager Interface
```
Methods:
- authenticateUser(username, password): User
- createUser(userData): boolean
- updateUser(userId, userData): boolean
- deleteUser(userId): boolean
- getUserById(userId): User
- getAllUsers(): List<User>
```

#### IBookCRUD Interface
```
Methods:
- addBook(bookData): boolean
- updateBook(bookId, bookData): boolean
- deleteBook(bookId): boolean
- getBookById(bookId): Book
- getAllBooks(): List<Book>
- searchBooks(criteria): List<Book>
```

#### IBookLending Interface
```
Methods:
- lendBook(userId, bookId): boolean
- returnBook(userId, bookId): boolean
- getBorrowedBooks(userId): List<Book>
- getAvailableBooks(): List<Book>
- getBorrowingHistory(userId): List<BorrowingRecord>
```

### 4.2 Class Structure

#### UserManager Class
**Implements:** IUserManager
**Responsibilities:**
- User authentication and session management
- User CRUD operations
- Password hashing and validation
- Role-based access control

#### BookManager Class
**Implements:** IBookCRUD, IBookLending
**Responsibilities:**
- Book inventory management
- Lending and return operations
- Book availability tracking
- Borrowing record maintenance

## 5. Data Storage Specification

### 5.1 File Structure
**Three separate data files:**
1. `users.[ext]` - User information storage
2. `books.[ext]` - Book information storage
3. `borrowing_records.[ext]` - Lending/borrowing transaction records

### 5.2 Supported File Formats
- `.txt` - Plain text with delimiter separation
- `.json` - JSON format for structured data
- `.xml` - XML format with defined schema

### 5.3 Data Persistence Requirements
- Atomic file operations to prevent data corruption
- Backup mechanism for data recovery
- Data validation before file write operations

## 6. Advanced Features

### 6.1 Book Request System
**Workflow:**
1. Regular user submits borrowing request for available book
2. Request is stored with PENDING status
3. Admin views pending requests upon login
4. Admin can approve or reject requests
5. Approved requests automatically update book status
6. Users are notified of request status changes

### 6.2 Security Implementation
**Password Security:**
- Passwords stored using secure hashing algorithm (SHA-256 minimum)
- Salt-based hashing to prevent rainbow table attacks
- Option for encryption-based storage

**Session Management:**
- User authentication tokens
- Role-based method access control
- Secure logout functionality

## 7. System Constraints

### 7.1 Functional Constraints
- Single book copy per title (no quantity management)
- File-based storage only (no database integration)
- Command-line or simple GUI interface

### 7.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- Response time: < 2 seconds for file operations
- Data integrity: Atomic operations for data consistency
- Scalability: Support up to 10,000 books and 1,000 users

## 8. Future Enhancement Opportunities

### 8.1 Immediate Extensions
- Multiple book copies management
- Due date notifications
- Fine calculation system
- Book reservation system

### 8.2 Advanced Extensions
- Database migration capability
- Web-based interface
- Email notifications
- Reporting and analytics
- Book recommendation system
